## Lecture 2
<details>
    <summary>Computer</summary>
    is an advanced electornic device that takes raw data as input and processes these data under a set of instructions and gives the output and saves the output.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>How many functions does a computer have and what are they?</summary>
    1. accept data: Input <br />
    2. process data: Processing <br />
    3. produces output: Output <br />
    4. stores results: Storage <br />
</details>

<details>
    <summary>how many entities digital computer system is divided into?</summary>
    1. software <br />
    2. hardware <br />
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Software system</summary>
    Operating system, application programs, programming languages.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Hardware system</summary>
    printer, mouse, keyboard, .., etc.
</details>


<details>
    <summary>what are the steps of instructing a computer?</summary>
    1. write a program <br />
    2. compile it <br />
    3. execute it <br />
</details>

<details>
    <summary>how many components does Von Neumann consist?</summary>
    1. input unit <br />
    2. output unit <br />
    3. arithmetic logic unit <br />
    4. memory unit <br />
    5. control unit <br />
</details>

<details>
    <summary>The System Bus Model</summary>
    It is a refinement of the von Neumann model which has a CPU, memory and IO unit.
</details>

    <img src="images/lec2_bus_model.png" />
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What system bus is made up of?</summary>
    1. data bus <br />
    2. address bus <br />
    3. control bus <br />
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ISA</summary>
    it is the semantics of all instructions supported by a processor.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What features an ISA must contain?</summary>
    1. Complete <br />
    2. Concise <br />
    3. Generic <br />
    4. Simple <br />
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Concise in ISA</summary>
    The instruction set should have a limited size 32 - 1000 instructions.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Generic in ISA</summary>
    Instructions should not be too specialized
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Simple</summary>
    should not be very compliated
</details>

<details>
    <summary>How many ISA paradigms do we have?</summary>
    1. RISC <br />
    2. CISC <br />
</details>

<details>
    <summary>RISC</summary>
    Implements simple instructions that have a simple regular structure.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>CISC</summary>
    implements complex instructions that are highly irregular, take multiple operands.
</details>
<br />
